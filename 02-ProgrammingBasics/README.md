# Chapter 2: Programming Basics

In this section you will be introduced to the most basic concepts of programming; variables, data structures, and control statements.

Programming is little more that reading data and piecing together statements that take action on that data. This is typically done by making a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). In programming these decision trees are constructed using [control-structures](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Control_structures) which tend to flow based upon the current value of a memory addresses most commonly known as a variable.  

In this section you will learn about:
* variables
* data types
* control structures

The goal of this section is to provide an overview of basic programming concepts.
