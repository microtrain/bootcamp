# Toolkits

Utilizing a toolkit can reduce the time it takes to get your product to market. Toolkits often take care of the repetitive tasks that while necessary change very little from project to project. These ofter employ "best" or "common" practices. While we will discuss a few toolkits our focus will be on only one; [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## [HTML Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)

I would describe HTML5 Boilerplate as a collection of good practices, especially for those using Apache and it comes with a nice .htacces file that explains each setting in great detail.

## [Material Design Light](https://getmdl.io/)
Material Design is Google's take on UI.

## [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
A responsive, mobile first front end library.
