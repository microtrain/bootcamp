## Lab 1 - Use a Layout

Convert all existing pages under */var/www/example.com* to a use layout.php.

## Lab 2 - Add Meta Data

Add meta data to all pages under */var/www/example.com*. It is not advisable to create meta tags in any case in which content will be blank. For this reason do not allow the tag to be added to the layout if the content is empty.

## Lab 3 - Create ToS pages

Add terms of service, privacy and cookie policies to your website.

Create the following files on the */var/www/example.com* path and link to them from the footer of your template. Be sure all of these pages use websites common theme.

* terms.php
* privacy.php
* cookies.php

These are legally binding agreements, as such you SHOULD always seek the advise of an attorney. If you do not want to do that there are a number template generators out there that will help you create your own policies. [TermsFeed](https://termsfeed.com/) is one such service, they offer a free generator for personal use and a modestly priced generator for business use. As I am not an attorney I cannot speak to the quality of these agreements for a production site. Having said that the below PDFs will be suitable for this class, if you are taking this site into production, I once again suggest consulting an attorney or using a generator once you have secured a domain name.
